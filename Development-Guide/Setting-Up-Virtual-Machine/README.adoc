= Steps to Setup a Virtual Machine on VirtualBox

. Download the latest https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[version of VirtualBox]
+
. Download the http://www.debian.org/[debian network installer image]. 
   * You can install a different operating system by downloading a different network installer image 
   * Recommended: debian-8.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso
+
. Open VirtualBox and create a new VM
   * In the name field enter the desired name for the VM ex. "_Debian for Pi_"
   * In the type field choose *Linux*
   * In the version field choose *Debian (64-bit)*
   * Set the memory size to *2GB (2000MB)* (recommended size, can be changed later if needed)
   * Choose "_create a virtual hard disk now_"
   * Select VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)
   * Proceed with the default settings 
+   
. Insert the Debian install DVD image into the VM storage
   * Select the VM created above and navigate to the settings icon in the menu bar
   * Then navigate to the storage icon in the new window and then _Controller : IDE_ 
      ** Click on the DVD image, it should say empty at this point
      ** Under _optical drive_ select the image downloaded in step 2
+
. Power on the VM and select install from the installer boot menu

+
. Go into _Activities_ and find _Terminal_ 
   * Type the command `su`
   * Next use the command `apt-get install sudo` (this will allow you to install git later)
   * Next type in the command `nano /etc/sudoers`
   * Scroll down to the line  `%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
         * Below that line type in: `<yourusernamehere>  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
   * Press  "Ctrl+x" then press "y" and then press [enter] to exit and save the file
   * To check if "_sudo_" is working:
         ** Type in the following command `sudo ls`
         ** type in your password
         ** If the output looks like the following, _sudo_ was installed successfully:
              *** `Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos`
   * Next run the command `sudo apt-get build-essential` (enables commands such as `g++`)
+ 
. Installing git
   * Type in the command, `sudo apt-get install update`
   * Followed by, `sudo apt-get install git`
+
. Now the desired repository can be cloned through the terminal
